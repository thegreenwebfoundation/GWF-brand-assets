## Who can use these assets and how?

Open source is a strong ethos running through everything we do at Green Web Foundation. We believe in the power of open to create a just and sustainable internet for all.

Therefore, you do not need to gain our explicit permission to use these brand assets when speaking about our organisation, our mission, our tools or a collaboration between us and your organisation.

We do ask that when you use these brand assets, you link to our main website when feasible to do so: https://thegreenwebfoundation.org, or other relevant tool that we operate. This helps a great deal.

We have more information on how you can [cite our open source work on our website](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/how-to-cite-our-work/). This covers our tools, Green Web Dataset and other content we make freely available to create a just and sustainable internet for all.

If you cannot find something in particular or want to chat about your use of our branding or our work, please contact our <a href="https://theegreenwebfoundation.org/support-form">support desk</a>, and we'll be happy to help.

### Fonts

#### For heading and copy text

The font is called Everett and requires a license to use.

It is designed by [Nolan Paparelli](https://www.nolan-paparelli.ch/) who describe it as such:

> Everett is a contemporary neo-grotesque typeface known for its characteristic sharpness. The fontâ€™s design is balanced with an organic drawing and a particular digital flavor. Strong typographic cuts add a high tension while still keeping a natural reading comfort, finding the right balance between a font that is graphic yet fluid.

The font can be licenses for use at [WeltKern](https://www.weltkern.com/shop/typefaces).

#### System alternative

The nearest system alternative font is Archivo. This is freely available for use on Google Fonts. [Archivo on Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Archivo).
