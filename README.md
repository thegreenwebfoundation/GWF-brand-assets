# The Green Web Foundation Assets

This repository contains assets you can use when creating Green Web Foundation public facing communications, products or services. 

This includes things like:

- logos in public communications and marketing collateral
- our own software
- any service that use the Green Web Foundation products and services themselves.
- our browser extensions

## Who can use these assets and how?

Open source is a strong ethos running through everything we do at Green Web Foundation. We believe in building a world that trusts people and makes it easy for them to operate.

Therefore, you do not need to gain our explicit permission to use these logos when speaking about our organisation, our mission, our tools or a collaboration between us and your organisations.

We do ask that when you use them, you link to our main website when feasible to do so: https://thegreenwebfoundation.org, or other relevant tool that we operate. This helps a great deal.

If you cannot find something in particular or want to chat about your use of our branding, please contact our <a href="https://theegreenwebfoundation.org/support-form">support desk</a>, and we'll be happy to help.

### Fonts

#### For heading and copy text

The font is called Everett and requires a license to use.

It is designed by [Nolan Paparelli](https://www.nolan-paparelli.ch/) who describe it as such:

> Everett is a contemporary neo-grotesque typeface known for its characteristic sharpness. The fontâ€™s design is balanced with an organic drawing and a particular digital flavor. Strong typographic cuts add a high tension while still keeping a natural reading comfort, finding the right balance between a font that is graphic yet fluid.

The font can be licenses for use at [WeltKern](https://www.weltkern.com/shop/typefaces).

#### System alternative

The nearest system alternative font is Archivo. This is freely available for use on Google Fonts. [Archivo on Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Archivo).
